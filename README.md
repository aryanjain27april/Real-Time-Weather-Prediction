This project implements the real time weather prediction system. It can be used in number of applications like homes, industries, agriculture, stadiums etc. for predicting the weather information. The system utilizes a temperature and humidity sensor i.e. DHT11. A model is used for setting up the machine learning environment. This model is trained using the pre- recorded values of sensor data.

Code Used In Node MCU Esp8266 is in NodeMCU_Code folder.
Python code is in Py_Code folder.
